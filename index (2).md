# Writings

* Scope Without Syntax: A Game Theoretic Approach. [PDF](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/scope-without-syntax/blob/master/prelim2.pdf).
: Second qualifying paper. 2017.
: A Game Theoretic analysis of quantifier scope, arguing that possible scope interpretations fall out from pragmatic assumptions about speaker/hearer intention. One empirical claim is that syntactic rigidity should universally correlate with scope ambiguity, while flexible languages/constructions tend to be scopally non-ambiguous.
