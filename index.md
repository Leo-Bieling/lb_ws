# About

**Leo Bieling** is a registered architect (UK, Germany and Austria) and part of the Computation and Design Research Group (ZHCODE) at **Zaha Hadid Architects** in London. His current research is motivated by observations regarding **data-driven design**, **digital fabrication technologies** and **emerging trends in contemporary living**.

Leo is co-author of the research paper **“Spatial Developable Meshes”**, which was published in the proceedings of the Design Modelling Symposium 2019 in Berlin. He has taught several international workshops including **CAARDIA** at the Tsinghua University Beijing, **RobArch** hosted at ETH Zurich, at the **Architectural Association DRL** and at the **B-Pro Bartlett** in London. In these courses, he continued his design-research in architectural geometry towards robotic and digital fabrication implementations. Previously he was a researcher in residence at the **AutoDesk BUILDspace in Boston** and a Student Assistant at the **Architectural Association’s Digital Prototyping Lab (DPL)**. During this time, he developed a strong understanding of the current state of the art digital fabrication methods. Leo’s previous work experience includes **Coop Himmelb(l)au** in Vienna, **Plus Architecture** in Melbourne and **Bieling Architekten** in Hamburg. He received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Degrees with distinction from the **TU Vienna**, Austria.
